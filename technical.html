            1. Here is the html code for lab01: <a href="./code.txt">lab2.html</a><br>
            2. I have a bunch of element CSS classes -- three of them are .container, .rocket, .planet in order for me to add the styles that create an animation around the top header of my website<br>
            3. I have a few global classes as well, such as for h1{ } h2{ } nav{} table {}<br>
            4. HTML5 only are tags are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Figure Element &lt;figure&gt; &lt;\figure&gt; which allows you to  associate captions with their image counterparts.</li>
                    <li>the New Doctype tag &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </li>
                    <li>the other thing is, or lack thereof, is removing the <i>type</i> attribute all together in the stylesheet link</li>
                </ul><br>
            5. CSS3 features are: 
                <ul>
                    <li>The linear-gradient background</li>
                    <li>The animation around the top of the page -- This allows you to have repeating animations that don't depend on user actions or JavaScript to get triggered</li>
                </ul>
            6. I used the same protection method<br>
            7. I spent around 2 hours on this lab. Less time than the last lab because I simply added to that one. But I struggled a bit with the animation.
